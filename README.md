# Expense_Data_Cleanup
This notebook was created to help clean and analyze expense data. It loads a CSV file, explores the data, and applies cleaning steps like handling missing values and detecting outliers using Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Isolation Forest. My goal is to make expense tracking more accurate and manageable.
